# employee-tracker

## Description 
This is command line application that was made to help create and track employees roles and salary for a company. This is helps the issues with having to manually type in a new employeee or updating a currenty employees role or salary. Working on this project I was able to apply what I learned in class about SQL for my first project. Also incorporating it with previous subjects learned in class such as javascript node and express.

## Installation 

This is node.js application. Use node -v to make sure you are up to date with most current package.
Please type the following in the terminal of your project folder in order to run the application smoothly:
npm i inquirer@8.2.4

npm i mysql2
